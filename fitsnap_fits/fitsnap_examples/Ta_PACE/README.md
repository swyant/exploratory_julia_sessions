## FitSnap3 Ta example with ACE


## Important Note
As with other ACE fits, regularization is highly
recommended. Please see Ta_PACE_Ridge and the TA_PACE_ARD
examples for practical use cases. This is an example using
SVD to obtain ACE coefficients, with group weights from
an optimized SNAP potential of Ta.
